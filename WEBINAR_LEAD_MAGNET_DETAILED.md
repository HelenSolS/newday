# NewDay Platform - Webinar Lead Magnet (Formerly 10-Day Anti-Stress Marathon)

## Important Concept Update
This is no longer a "marathon" but a flexible webinar format that can run for any number of days. The content structure and concepts remain the same, but the delivery format has been updated to be more flexible.

## Core Components to Implement

### 1. Nutritional Minimum (Essential for Trust and Value)

Each day includes a 1-minute story + self-reflection question to help participants integrate the habit and achieve micro-breakthroughs:

- **Day 1**: Why drinking water in the morning saves from anxiety? (cortisol, rehydration)
- **Day 2**: Why a protein breakfast is anti-stress?
- **Day 4**: Carbohydrates: enemies or allies?
- **Day 7**: What does "stress eating" mean? How to recognize it in the moment.
- **Day 9**: What to eat in the evening to not wake up from nighttime anxiety?

### 2. Self-Observation Questions (Daily)

Each day includes 2-3 questions such as:
- What am I feeling right now?
- Why am I eating this? Am I hungry or anxious?
- How does my body feel?
- Where in the body do I feel tension?
- Was there sports/movement today?
- Did I feel confident or avoid contact?

Important: The bot will request answers but not insist - participants can "postpone", creating respect for the participant.

### 3. Exercises: Physical + Mental

Alternating exercises:
- Joint gymnastics 3-5 min
- "Cat-dog", "arms up and down", neck turns
- Close eyes ‚Üí imagine yourself ‚Üí then approach mirror
- Exercise "I'm tired, but also..." 
- Meditation "Observing breath" 3 min
- Affirmation + pause: "I am safe" / "I choose to be gentle with myself"
- Gratitude: "3 things I can be grateful for today"
- Visual task: Draw how you feel right now

### 4. Visual Tests

Each day includes:
- Image with choice + question: what do you feel?
  - Order/mess/dirt
  - Seller (cold-neat, warm-messy)
  - Street kitten
  - Food choice (healthy/emotional/celebration)
  - Table with pies and fruits: what would you choose?

Those who "fall in love" with this format can take additional tests throughout the day.

### 5. Bot Workflow Structure (MVP)

**Morning delivery:**
- Greeting
- Affirmation of the day
- Visual test
- Nutrition fact + question
- Exercise/warm-up
- 2 self-observation questions

**Evening delivery:**
- Question of the day (summary)
- Gratitude/affirmation
- Brief summary: "Today you: ‚òë answered ‚òë stretched ‚òë understood more about yourself"

**Bot behavior:**
- If no answer - reminder
- If person writes "difficult" - bot responds gently: "Difficult is also an answer. You're doing great being here."

### 6. Day 10 - Inspirational

Participant receives:
- Mini-report
- Congratulations
- Visualization of their growth
- "You've taken the journey. Want to go deeper?"
- Call to action for the big marathon: "Here you began. There - you'll change much more."
