## Getting Started

1. Place your initial project documents in the `start` directory
2. Development work should be done in the `src` directory
3. Add documentation to the `docs` directory as needed
4. Place static assets in the `assets` directory
5. Write tests in the `tests` directory

## Workflow

1. Review and update the documents in the `start` directory
2. Begin implementation in the appropriate `src` subdirectory
3. Add tests as you develop features
4. Document significant decisions in the `docs` directory
